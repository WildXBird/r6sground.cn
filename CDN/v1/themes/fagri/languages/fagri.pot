msgid ""
"Fagri is a responsive WordPress theme, built to fit all kinds of "
"businesses. Its multipurpose design is great for small businesses, "
"startups, corporate businesses, freelancers, portfolios, WooCommerce, "
"creative agencies, or niche websites (medical, restaurants, sports, "
"fashion). Fagri was created on top of Now UI Kit and displays an elegant "
"one-page layout, complemented by the smooth parallax effect. The theme "
"comes with a clean look, but it also provides subtle hover animations. "
"Moreover, Fagri offers Sendinblue newsletter integration, a flexible "
"interface via Live Customizer, a widgetized footer, full compatibility with "
"Elementor and Beaver Builder, a full-width featured slider, and even more "
"functionality based on the latest WordPress trends. Last but not least, the "
"theme is lightweight and SEO-friendly."
