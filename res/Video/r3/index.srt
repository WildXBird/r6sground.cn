00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,660
Chris Watters: Operation Phantom Sight

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,240
is coming to Rainbow 6 Siege.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,169
The Phantom in this title is Nokk, an attacker

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,080
who uses her gadget to muffle her footsteps,

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,030
keep herself out of the spotlight,

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,010
and creep everyone right out.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,370
The Sight is Warden, a sharp dressed defender

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,179
whose glasses allow him to resist or recover from flashes

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,049
and to see more clearly when things get smoky.

10
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,750
We'll give you the details on these two new operators

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,490
and show you around the newly renovated Cafe Dostoyevsky,

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,280
no reservation necessary.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,179
First, let's meet the guy in the tie, Warden.

14
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:52,299
Fresh off a stint with the United States Secret Service,

15
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:55,149
Warden is a dapper defender who accessorizes

16
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:59,619
with his Glance smart glasses and a snazzy statement watch.

17
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:03,519
When things start popping off, Warden switches

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,969
glasses on to accomplish all of the following.

19
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:10,239
Number one, make himself immune to flashes.

20
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,649
Number two, remove any flash he is currently affected by.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,040
Number three, give him clearer sight through smoke.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,180
And number four, add some high tech panache to his I

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,000
just killed you scream.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,219
You can manually deactivate the glasses

25
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:30,370
or wait until they run out of juice and need to recharge.

26
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,369
Either way, there is a fixed cool down

27
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,359
before you can activate them again.

28
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,370
But there's no limit to how many times

29
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,140
you can use them in a match.

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,349
With his glasses active, Warden is a strong counter

31
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,539
against any smoke and flash party

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,340
that the attackers try to throw.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,969
If Blitz gets frisky or Ying lights

34
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,280
up a whole mess of Candelas, Warden

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,140
will be having none of it.

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,030
Even Glaz will have to think twice

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,120
about setting up behind his precious smoke screen,

38
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,010
though he still has an edge on Warden

39
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,989
with his bigger scope and thermal detection.

40
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,549
Note that the smoke filtering feature on Warden's glasses

41
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:10,359
is less effective if he's moving, so picking smart angles

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,180
and repositioning quickly are vital to making

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,800
the most of his gadget.

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,719
And while his glasses are active,

45
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,460
you'll need to watch out for the gadget

46
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,349
disabling and gadget detecting powers of Thatcher and IQ.

47
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:27,939
But as a high armor, low speed operator wielding either an MPX

48
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,379
submachine gun or an M590A1 shotgun,

49
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:37,180
Warden makes for a strong anchor and he looks good doing it.

50
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,050
Hailing from a different quadrant of the fashion galaxy,

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,280
we have Nook.

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,650
This attacker from Denmark's Jaeger Corps

53
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,810
may have an eye-catchingly eerie get up

54
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,979
but she would actually prefer it if you didn't notice her

55
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,209
at all.

56
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,099
So when her hell presence reduction gadget is active,

57
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,639
you won't hear her footsteps and you won't see any sign of her

58
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,829
on camera feeds.

59
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,870
It's a little spooky.

60
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,090
And with all the different potential camera

61
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,500
feeds available to defenders these days,

62
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,949
Nokk's ability to hide from them all is all the more alarming.

63
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:18,549
Her gadget runs off a recharging meter like Warden's glasses

64
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,481
but, unlike Warden's glasses, there's no required cool

65
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:25,839
down so Nook can turn her gadget on and off and on again

66
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,969
whenever she has the juice to run it,

67
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,259
giving her more tactical flexibility.

68
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,750
And activating her gadget doesn't require

69
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,060
her to change weapons, so she can

70
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,159
continue wielding her primary, an FMG9 submachine gun or 612SD

71
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,939
shotgun, or her secondary, a Five-SeveN USG

72
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:49,810
pistol or a D50 pistol with an equippable suppressor.

73
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,800
This makes Nokk a formidable flanking and fragging threat

74
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,900
though, like any operator, she has her limitations.

75
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,719
Nokk's gadget will glitch and be visible on camera

76
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,250
feeds if she performs basically any action except moving

77
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,770
at a normal speed or slower, crouching

78
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,650
and moving, or reloading or swapping weapons.

79
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,310
You can also keep an eye out for environmental clues,

80
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,370
like breach debris moving of its own accord.

81
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,709
Or you could take a more proactive approach

82
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,800
and throw down some barbed wire razor wire.

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,949
Nokk will glitch while passing through it.

84
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,379
If you really want to make things tricky for Nokk,

85
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,540
take Lesion and his goo mines.

86
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,430
She'll glitch when she steps on one,

87
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,199
glitch every time she takes damage,

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,449
and glitch while she pulls out the needle.

89
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,569
Aside from the glitch, the only other camera interference

90
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,909
that will let you know Nokk is nearby

91
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,079
is this wave form effect that appears

92
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,139
when using Mozzie's hacked drones or Echo's Yokai.

93
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,079
Every other camera will have a hard time seeing,

94
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,699
and your ears will have a hard time

95
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,639
hearing, this medium speed, medium armor attacker.

96
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,939
Team Nokk up with a roamer hunting operator

97
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,399
or take her on a sneaky flanking route

98
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,049
and you've got a powerful new way

99
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,410
to unsettle the defending team.

100
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,870
The map you've been seeing here may look familiar.

101
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,389
It's Cafe Dostoyevsky or Cafe to its friends.

102
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,769
The seige team has renovated this lovely three story

103
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,589
gathering spot, creating new bomb sites,

104
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,159
making old sites more viable, and generally sprucing things

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,040
up for more balanced encounters.

106
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,980
For example, enter through the new reception area and you'll

107
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,290
find a stairwell has moved, opening up

108
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,480
new possibilities for opening up the reading room.

109
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,220
The kitchen area has been extensively remodeled and given

110
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,389
a festive touch.

111
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,399
And there's even been some light roof work.

112
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,199
The shiny new cafe map will replace the old cafe map

113
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,789
for free when Operation Phantom Sight launches.

114
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,160
The two new operators, Warden and Nokk,

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,220
will be available at launch for Year Four pass owners

116
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,750
and unlockable for all players seven days later

117
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,829
by using Renown or R6 credits.
