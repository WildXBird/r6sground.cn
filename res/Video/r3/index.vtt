00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.660
Chris Watters: Operation Phantom Sight

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.240
is coming to Rainbow 6 Siege.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.169
The Phantom in this title is Nokk, an attacker

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.080
who uses her gadget to muffle her footsteps,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.030
keep herself out of the spotlight,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.010
and creep everyone right out.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.370
The Sight is Warden, a sharp dressed defender

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.179
whose glasses allow him to resist or recover from flashes

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.049
and to see more clearly when things get smoky.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:36.750
We'll give you the details on these two new operators

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.490
and show you around the newly renovated Cafe Dostoyevsky,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.280
no reservation necessary.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.179
First, let's meet the guy in the tie, Warden.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.299
Fresh off a stint with the United States Secret Service,

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.149
Warden is a dapper defender who accessorizes

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.619
with his Glance smart glasses and a snazzy statement watch.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.519
When things start popping off, Warden switches

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.969
glasses on to accomplish all of the following.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.239
Number one, make himself immune to flashes.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:14.649
Number two, remove any flash he is currently affected by.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.040
Number three, give him clearer sight through smoke.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.180
And number four, add some high tech panache to his I

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.000
just killed you scream.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.219
You can manually deactivate the glasses

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.370
or wait until they run out of juice and need to recharge.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.369
Either way, there is a fixed cool down

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.359
before you can activate them again.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.370
But there's no limit to how many times

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.140
you can use them in a match.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.349
With his glasses active, Warden is a strong counter

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:43.539
against any smoke and flash party

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.340
that the attackers try to throw.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.969
If Blitz gets frisky or Ying lights

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.280
up a whole mess of Candelas, Warden

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.140
will be having none of it.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.030
Even Glaz will have to think twice

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.120
about setting up behind his precious smoke screen,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.010
though he still has an edge on Warden

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.989
with his bigger scope and thermal detection.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.549
Note that the smoke filtering feature on Warden's glasses

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.359
is less effective if he's moving, so picking smart angles

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.180
and repositioning quickly are vital to making

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.800
the most of his gadget.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.719
And while his glasses are active,

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.460
you'll need to watch out for the gadget

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.349
disabling and gadget detecting powers of Thatcher and IQ.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.939
But as a high armor, low speed operator wielding either an MPX

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.379
submachine gun or an M590A1 shotgun,

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.180
Warden makes for a strong anchor and he looks good doing it.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.050
Hailing from a different quadrant of the fashion galaxy,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.280
we have Nook.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.650
This attacker from Denmark's Jaeger Corps

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.810
may have an eye-catchingly eerie get up

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.979
but she would actually prefer it if you didn't notice her

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.209
at all.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.099
So when her hell presence reduction gadget is active,

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.639
you won't hear her footsteps and you won't see any sign of her

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.829
on camera feeds.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.870
It's a little spooky.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.090
And with all the different potential camera

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.500
feeds available to defenders these days,

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.949
Nokk's ability to hide from them all is all the more alarming.

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:18.549
Her gadget runs off a recharging meter like Warden's glasses

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.481
but, unlike Warden's glasses, there's no required cool

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:25.839
down so Nook can turn her gadget on and off and on again

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.969
whenever she has the juice to run it,

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.259
giving her more tactical flexibility.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:34.750
And activating her gadget doesn't require

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.060
her to change weapons, so she can

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.159
continue wielding her primary, an FMG9 submachine gun or 612SD

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.939
shotgun, or her secondary, a Five-SeveN USG

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.810
pistol or a D50 pistol with an equippable suppressor.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.800
This makes Nokk a formidable flanking and fragging threat

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.900
though, like any operator, she has her limitations.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.719
Nokk's gadget will glitch and be visible on camera

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:06.250
feeds if she performs basically any action except moving

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.770
at a normal speed or slower, crouching

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.650
and moving, or reloading or swapping weapons.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.310
You can also keep an eye out for environmental clues,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.370
like breach debris moving of its own accord.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.709
Or you could take a more proactive approach

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.800
and throw down some barbed wire razor wire.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.949
Nokk will glitch while passing through it.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.379
If you really want to make things tricky for Nokk,

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.540
take Lesion and his goo mines.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.430
She'll glitch when she steps on one,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.199
glitch every time she takes damage,

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.449
and glitch while she pulls out the needle.

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.569
Aside from the glitch, the only other camera interference

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.909
that will let you know Nokk is nearby

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.079
is this wave form effect that appears

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:50.139
when using Mozzie's hacked drones or Echo's Yokai.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.079
Every other camera will have a hard time seeing,

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:54.699
and your ears will have a hard time

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.639
hearing, this medium speed, medium armor attacker.

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.939
Team Nokk up with a roamer hunting operator

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.399
or take her on a sneaky flanking route

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.049
and you've got a powerful new way

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.410
to unsettle the defending team.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.870
The map you've been seeing here may look familiar.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.389
It's Cafe Dostoyevsky or Cafe to its friends.

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.769
The seige team has renovated this lovely three story

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:22.589
gathering spot, creating new bomb sites,

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.159
making old sites more viable, and generally sprucing things

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.040
up for more balanced encounters.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.980
For example, enter through the new reception area and you'll

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.290
find a stairwell has moved, opening up

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.480
new possibilities for opening up the reading room.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.220
The kitchen area has been extensively remodeled and given

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.389
a festive touch.

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:44.399
And there's even been some light roof work.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.199
The shiny new cafe map will replace the old cafe map

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:53.789
for free when Operation Phantom Sight launches.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.160
The two new operators, Warden and Nokk,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.220
will be available at launch for Year Four pass owners

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.750
and unlockable for all players seven days later

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.829
by using Renown or R6 credits.

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:07.740
